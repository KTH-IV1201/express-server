# CORS Example, Backend

This project was adapted from the code examples at [https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/react-cors-guide-what-it-is-and-how-to-enable-it/](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/react-cors-guide-what-it-is-and-how-to-enable-it/). It's the backend of a CORS example, the corresponding frontend is in the [react-client](https://github.com/KTH-IV1201/react-client.git) repository.
